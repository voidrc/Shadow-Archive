Not all targets—like **DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web App)**—come with an ISO. Instead, they need to be deployed using **Docker** or other containerization platforms.
By setting up a **Fedora Server VM**, we create a **powerful and stable environment** for hosting **vulnerable containers**, running **web services**, and managing **self-hosted applications**.

📥 Get the **Fedora Server ISO** from [here](https://fedoraproject.org/server/).
