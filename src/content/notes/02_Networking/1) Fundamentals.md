# A) Network Components

## Clients
Devices that Users access the network with

These can be any device that simply connects network:
- Workstations
- Laptops
- Tablets
- Smartphones
- Smart TVs

## Servers
Provides  resources to the network
Common examples:
- Email Servers
- Files Servers 
- Web Servers
- HoneyPots

These servers can be any dedicated hardwares, or within system with help of containerization

## Hubs 
Older network devices that connect other devices like clients and servers over a  local area network.

Hubs have limitations such as increased network errors due to their broadcasting nature.

Hubs --> Bridges --> Switches

## Switches
"Smarter hubs" that provide more security and more efficient bandwidth utilization. It delivers from one Port to only destination port, and this helps to prevent unwanted broadcast of data.

## Wireless Access Points (WAPs/APs)
Allow wireless devices to connect to a wired network. It works like Hub but using Radio Frequency(RF) Waves.

## Routers
Used to connect different networks together. Router can make intelligent forwarding decisions basedon IP addresses of the different clients, servers or other devices.

Modern Routers are predominantly going to rely on the internet protocol to route the traffic across the network using different routing protocols.

## Firewalls
Security barriers between internal networks and the Internet. Controls Incoming and Outgoing data flow based upon predetermined security rules by using access control lists. These firewalls can be Hardware based, Software based, or Combination of both.

## Load Balancers
Devices or software that distributes network or application traffic across multiple servers. This is going to prevent any one of servers to become Bottleneck, this increases efficiency, capacity, and reliability of services, improving overall network performance.

## Proxies
Acts as  an intermediary between a user's device and the Internet.
Functionalities:
- Web filtering
- Shared Network Connections
- Data Caching
- Enhanced Security and Privacy

## Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems(IDS/IPS)
IDS: Detect unauthorized access or anomalies and alert administrators
IPS: Not only detect threats, but also take action to prevent intrusion

## Controllers
In Software-Defined Networking(SDN) context, these are central units used to manages flow control to networking devices.

## Network-attached Storage(NAS) Devices
Dedicated file storage system that provides data access to heterogeneous group of clients.

## Storage Area Network(SAN)
High-Speed network that provides access to consolidated block-level data storage.

## Media
In networking,, it refers to the physical materials used to transmit data.

## Wide Area Network(WAN) Link
Used to connect networks over large geographical areas.
