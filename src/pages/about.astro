	<p>
		As of June 12, 2025 — I am <strong>.voidrc</strong>. A Cyber-Security student with a curious mind, a day-dreaming spirit, a lazy streak I’m learning to tame, and a logic-driven approach to life. 
		I like to imagine myself as the villain in a world full of default heroes — not because I am evil, but because I think differently.
	</p>

	<p>
		My journey into cybersecurity started young — drawn in by a deep interest in technology and a long-standing addiction to gaming (a battle I'm still fighting). 
		The turning point? The first time I used cheats to win a game. That moment sparked something deeper: a desire not just to play, but to understand, bend, and break systems. 
		That’s when I decided — I want to become a hacker.
	</p>

	<p>
		Driven by that early obsession, I began exploring on mobile using Termux — picking up bits of knowledge, mostly theoretical and wildly unsorted. 
		Everything changed when I got my first PC just a year ago. Since then, I’ve taught myself Linux (Arch, by the way), networking fundamentals, and a bit of scripting. 
		But again — fragmented, inconsistent, and lacking real application.
	</p>

	<p>
		This is exactly why I’m building this archive. My ultimate goal? To store, organize, and share everything I learn — not just for me, but for others starting the same journey. 
		I’m still new to the game, but this vault isn’t a collection of tips from elite professionals. It’s the living story of a regular kid who decided to bend the system to his will.
	</p>

	<p>
		My focus lies in <strong>Red Teaming</strong> and <strong>Malware Development</strong> — both perfectly aligned with my early obsession. To exploit a system, you must know how to breach it. 
		To breach it effectively, you need the right tools. Red Teaming finds the path to superiority; malware development forges the weapons to travel it.
	</p>

	<p>
		This archive will serve as both a personal vault and a public roadmap. It will document everything I learn — organized notes, small discoveries, tips, 
		and real-world projects or tools I’ve built or contributed to. It’s my living proof of growth. A place for others to learn, get inspired, or even find their starting point.
	</p>

	<h2>Motto:</h2>
	<p>
		Don’t break rules. <strong>Just dissect them alive… to see how loud they scream.</strong>
